# AI Marketplace Platform - Agent Operating Directive

*Last Updated: 2025-07-30*

## CRITICAL: Homepage Protection Protocol ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üö® PROTECTED FILES - DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

**PRIMARY PROTECTED FILE:**
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - **HOMEPAGE IS PROTECTED** üõ°Ô∏è
  - This file contains the restored homepage with cosmic design
  - **DO NOT MODIFY** without explicit user permission
  - Always verify integrity before any changes
  - Backup available at `/src/app/page-PROTECTED-BASELINE.tsx`

**HOMEPAGE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:**
1. **Before ANY homepage modification:**
   - Ask explicit user permission: "Are you sure you want to modify the protected homepage?"
   - Compare with baseline backup file for integrity verification
   - Document the reason for modification
   - Create timestamped backup before changes

2. **After ANY project changes:**
   - Verify homepage `/src/app/page.tsx` is unchanged
   - Check that all imports and components still function
   - Test homepage navigation and visual elements

3. **If homepage corruption detected:**
   - IMMEDIATELY restore from `/src/app/page-PROTECTED-BASELINE.tsx`
   - Report the issue to user
   - Document in ERROR_RESOLUTION_LOG.md

### üîí Critical Preservation Checklist

**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK:**
- [ ] Verify homepage integrity at `/src/app/page.tsx`
- [ ] Check that protected baseline exists
- [ ] Confirm no accidental modifications to critical UI components
- [ ] Review any changes that might affect navigation or layouts

**PROTECTED COMPONENTS:**

**Server Stability Scripts:**
```bash
# Proactive stability management
npm run dev:stable            # Robust server startup (recommended)
npm run health-check          # Comprehensive system health verification
npm run emergency-restart     # Nuclear option - complete reset

# Server health monitoring
npm run test-endpoints        # Test critical API endpoints
npm run server-status         # Check port and process status
npm run monitor-logs          # Watch for errors and warnings

# Development assistance
npm run lint                  # Code quality check
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript validation
npm run build                # Production build test

# Homepage protection
npm run verify-homepage       # Compare with protected baseline
npm run restore-homepage      # Restore from backup if needed
```

**Proactive Monitoring with Playwright MCP Integration:**

**üöÄ BEFORE REPORTING PAGE STATUS - MANDATORY PROTOCOLS:**

**1. Automated Health Check Protocol:**
```bash
# ALWAYS run before any page status report
npm run health-check

# If ANY issues detected, auto-fix with:
npm run dev:stable
```

**2. Playwright MCP Web Page Monitoring:**
When agents use Playwright MCP to check web pages:

**a) Pre-Check Requirements:**
- ALWAYS run `npm run health-check` before taking screenshots
- If console errors detected, run stability protocols FIRST
- Document any stability issues in monitoring log

**b) Console Error Detection Patterns:**
```javascript
// Auto-detect these critical errors in browser console:
- "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/routes-manifest.json'"
- "Module not found" errors
- "Hydration" errors
- "Internal Server Error" messages
```

**c) Automatic Recovery Triggers:**
```bash
# If console errors detected, IMMEDIATELY run:
npm run dev:stable

# Then verify fix with:
npm run health-check

# Only THEN proceed with page status reporting
```

**3. Monitoring Log Integration:**
All page checks must document findings in `docs/MONITORING_LOG.md`:
```markdown
## Date: 2025-07-30 - Time: 14:30
- Page: /setup
- Status: ‚ùå Console errors detected
- Action: Ran npm run dev:stable
- Resolution: ‚úÖ Page operational after stability restart
- Agent: Playwright MCP
```

**Proactive Monitoring Protocols:**
- **Real-time server health monitoring**: `scripts/health-check.sh`
- **API endpoint availability checking**: Automated curl testing
- **Homepage integrity verification**: Protected file comparison
- **Performance metrics tracking**: Response time monitoring
- **Console error detection**: Automatic browser console monitoring
- **Stability auto-recovery**: Proactive server restart protocols

### **6. PLAYWRIGHT MCP INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS** ‚≠ê **PROACTIVE MONITORING**

**üéØ MANDATORY FOR ALL WEB PAGE CHECKS:**

**Before Any Playwright MCP Operation:**
```bash
# Step 1: Always run health check first
npm run health-check

# Step 2: If ANY issues detected, auto-fix immediately  
npm run dev:stable

# Step 3: Verify resolution
npm run health-check

# Step 4: Only THEN proceed with Playwright operations
```

**Playwright MCP Console Error Detection:**
```javascript
// Automatically detect these patterns in browser console:
const criticalErrors = [
  "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/routes-manifest.json'",
  "Module not found", 
  "Hydration failed",
  "Internal Server Error",
  "Network Error",
  "Compilation failed"
];

// Auto-trigger recovery if detected:
if (consoleErrors.includes(criticalErrors)) {
  await runCommand('npm run dev:stable');
  await runCommand('npm run health-check');
}
```

**Web Page Monitoring Workflow:**
1. **Pre-Check**: Run `npm run health-check` 
2. **Navigate**: Use Playwright to load page
3. **Console Scan**: Check for critical errors automatically
4. **Auto-Recovery**: If errors detected, run stability protocols
5. **Verification**: Confirm page operational before reporting
6. **Documentation**: Log all actions in `docs/MONITORING_LOG.md`

**Required Playwright MCP Commands Integration:**
```bash
# Before mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
npm run health-check

# Before mcp__playwright__browser_navigate  
npm run health-check

# Before mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot
npm run health-check

# If console errors detected during any operation:
npm run dev:stable && npm run health-check
```

**Error Pattern ‚Üí Action Mapping:**
- **Routes manifest missing** ‚Üí `npm run dev:stable`
- **Module resolution errors** ‚Üí `npm run dev:stable` 
- **Hydration mismatches** ‚Üí `npm run dev:stable`
- **API endpoint failures** ‚Üí `npm run health-check && npm run test-endpoints`
