### Detailed Security Assessment

## 1. API Key Security During Testing ‚úÖ SECURE

### Current Implementation
- **Google Cloud KMS Encryption**: All API keys encrypted with envelope encryption
- **Customer Context Binding**: Keys bound to user context preventing substitution attacks
- **Secure Hash Verification**: SHA-256 integrity verification for all stored keys
- **Key Preview System**: Only last 4 characters exposed in UI

### Testing Security Measures
```typescript
// Encrypted storage format (from api-key-manager.ts)
encryptedKey: JSON.stringify({
  encryptedData: encryptionResult.encryptedData,
  encryptedDEK: encryptionResult.encryptedDEK,
  salt: encryptionResult.salt,
  iv: encryptionResult.iv,
  authTag: encryptionResult.authTag,
  context: encryptionResult.context,
  algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM+KMS',
  createdAt: encryptionResult.createdAt.toISOString()
})
```

### Risk Assessment: üü¢ **LOW RISK**
- ‚úÖ API keys never stored in plain text
- ‚úÖ Encryption/decryption cycles verified working
- ‚úÖ Test data cleanup procedures implemented

### Data Transmission Security
- **TLS 1.3 Encryption**: All API calls to providers use HTTPS
- **Request/Response Logging**: Sanitized logging without sensitive data
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without key exposure

### Security Implementation
```typescript
// From SecurityUtils.sanitizeErrorMessage
sanitizeErrorMessage(error: Error): string {
  let message = error.message;
  
  // Remove potential API keys
  message = message.replace(/sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}/g, '[REDACTED_OPENAI_KEY]');
  message = message.replace(/sk-ant-api[a-zA-Z0-9\-]{95}/g, '[REDACTED_ANTHROPIC_KEY]');
  
  // Remove potential secrets
  message = message.replace(/secret[:\s]*[a-zA-Z0-9+/=]{16,}/gi, '[REDACTED_SECRET]');
  message = message.replace(/token[:\s]*[a-zA-Z0-9\-_.]{16,}/gi, '[REDACTED_TOKEN]');
  
  return message;
}
```
