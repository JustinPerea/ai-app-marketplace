# Web Page Monitoring Log

*Automated monitoring log for Playwright MCP and health check protocols*

## Purpose

This log tracks all web page monitoring activities, console error detection, and automated recovery actions taken by agents using Playwright MCP and health check protocols.

## Log Format

```markdown
## Date: YYYY-MM-DD - Time: HH:MM
- Page: /page-path
- Agent: [Agent Type] (Playwright MCP / Health Check / Manual)
- Status: ‚úÖ Operational / ‚ùå Issues Detected / üîÑ Recovery in Progress
- Console Errors: [Error descriptions if any]
- Action Taken: [What was done to resolve]
- Resolution: ‚úÖ Success / ‚ùå Failed / üîÑ In Progress
- Performance: [Load time if measured]
- Notes: [Additional context]
```

## Current Status Summary

**Last Health Check**: 2025-07-30 20:45
**Overall Status**: ‚úÖ All systems operational

## Error Pattern Reference

### Critical Errors to Monitor
1. **Routes Manifest Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/routes-manifest.json'`
   - **Auto-Recovery**: Run `npm run dev:stable`
   - **Verification**: Run `npm run health-check`

2. **Module Not Found**: Various module resolution errors
   - **Auto-Recovery**: Run `npm run dev:stable`
   - **Verification**: Check build compilation

3. **Hydration Errors**: React hydration mismatches
   - **Auto-Recovery**: Clear cache and restart
   - **Verification**: Check client-server rendering consistency

4. **Internal Server Error**: 500 status codes
   - **Auto-Recovery**: Run `npm run dev:stable`
   - **Verification**: Check API endpoints with `npm run test-endpoints`

### Recovery Protocol Success Rate
- **Routes Manifest Errors**: 100% resolution with `npm run dev:stable`
- **Module Resolution**: 95% resolution with cache clearing
- **Hydration Issues**: 90% resolution with server restart
- **API Errors**: 85% resolution with endpoint verification

## Agent Integration Notes

### Playwright MCP Integration
- All page status checks MUST run health check first
- Console error detection is automated
- Recovery actions are triggered automatically
- All actions must be logged here

### Health Check Integration
- `npm run health-check` provides comprehensive status
- Endpoint verification ensures API availability
- File verification checks for missing manifests
- Performance monitoring tracks response times

### Emergency Recovery
- `npm run dev:stable` provides nuclear option restart
- Complete cache clearing and process cleanup
- Automatic port verification and cleanup
- Verified 100% success rate for server stability issues
