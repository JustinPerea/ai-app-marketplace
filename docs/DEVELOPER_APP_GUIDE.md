## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Guide

### **Step 1: SDK Setup**

```typescript
// Install our orchestration SDK
npm install @ai-marketplace/sdk

// Basic setup
import { ai } from '@ai-marketplace/sdk';

// Your app can now leverage intelligent multi-provider routing
const result = await ai.complete({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userInput }],
  strategy: 'cost_optimized', // or 'performance', 'privacy_first'
  requirements: {
    reasoning: true,    // Needs advanced reasoning
    privacy: 'hipaa'    // HIPAA compliance required
  },
  constraints: {
    maxCost: 0.05,      // Maximum cost per request
    maxLatency: 5000    // Maximum response time
  }
});
```

### **Step 2: Multi-Provider Strategy**

#### **Smart Provider Selection**
```typescript
// Example: Legal Contract Analyzer
const contractAnalysis = await ai.complete({
  prompt: `Analyze this contract for risks: ${contractText}`,
  strategy: 'balanced',
  requirements: {
    reasoning: true,    // Claude or GPT-4 for complex analysis
    analysis: true      // Structured analytical thinking
  },
  constraints: {
    maxCost: 0.10,      // Budget-conscious legal practices
    privacyLevel: 'private' // Confidential documents
  }
});

// Platform automatically:
// 1. Selects Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best for reasoning + privacy)
// 2. Falls back to GPT-4o if Claude unavailable
// 3. Uses local Llama if privacy level requires local processing
// 4. Optimizes costs while maintaining quality
```

#### **Multi-Step Workflows**
```typescript
// Example: Medical Scribe Application
const medicalWorkflow = await ai.workflow([
  {
    name: 'transcribe',
    prompt: 'Convert audio to text: ${audioData}',
    strategy: 'cost_optimized',    // Use cheapest transcription
    requirements: { privacy: 'hipaa' } // Must be local for HIPAA
  },
  {
    name: 'structure',
    prompt: 'Create SOAP notes from: {{ transcribe.output }}',
    strategy: 'privacy_first',     // Keep medical data local
    requirements: { analysis: true }
  },
  {
    name: 'review',
    prompt: 'Quality check medical notes: {{ structure.output }}',
    strategy: 'performance',       // Fast validation
    requirements: { reasoning: true }
  }
]);

// Each step uses optimal provider for that specific task
// Total cost optimized across the entire workflow
```

### **Step 3: Cost Optimization Implementation**

#### **Built-in Cost Controls**
```typescript
// Automatic cost optimization
const costOptimizedResult = await ai.complete({
  prompt: userQuery,
  strategy: 'cost_optimized',
  constraints: {
    maxCost: userBudget,          // Respect user's budget
    fallbackStrategy: 'local'     // Use free local models as fallback
  }
});

// Real-time cost tracking
console.log(`Actual cost: $${costOptimizedResult.cost.total}`);
console.log(`Saved vs most expensive: $${costOptimizedResult.cost.savings}`);
console.log(`Efficiency score: ${costOptimizedResult.cost.efficiency}%`);
```

#### **User Cost Transparency**
```typescript
// Show cost estimates before processing
const estimate = await ai.estimateCost({
  prompt: userInput,
  strategy: selectedStrategy,
  requirements: appRequirements
});

// Display to user: "This will cost approximately $0.03"
// Let users choose cost vs speed trade-offs
```

### **Step 4: Privacy & Compliance**

#### **HIPAA-Compliant Processing**
```typescript
// Medical data processing
const hipaaCompliant = await ai.complete({
  prompt: medicalData,
  constraints: {
    privacyLevel: 'hipaa',        // Forces local processing
    auditTrail: true              // Logs for compliance
  }
});

// Guarantees:
// ✅ Data never leaves user's infrastructure
// ✅ Full audit trail for compliance
// ✅ Local model processing only
// ✅ No cloud provider data exposure
```

#### **Privacy-Aware Routing**
```typescript
// Automatic privacy level detection
const smartPrivacy = await ai.complete({
  prompt: userInput,
  strategy: 'privacy_first',
  // Platform automatically detects sensitive content
  // Routes to local processing when needed
  // Uses cloud providers for non-sensitive content
});
```
